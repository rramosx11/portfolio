## Description

In this challenge I was tasked with created my portfolio from scratch. I created the structure of the webpage in the html while formatting with CSS.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Portfolio Features

- My portfolio has my name, recent photo, and the navigation will redirect to the section of the portfolio.
- My resume nav link downloads my most recent resume pre bootcamp.
- I have included my contact information with my phone number, email, github, and my Linkedin.
- I have a container the projects that I have completed. I currently have two placeholder images and links to update as I complete more projects.
- My first application is the largest in size. When clicked you are redirected to the deployed URL.
- I have multiple hover effects on my navigation bar, contact information, and on my work. My work also has opacity effects that focus up when I hover over them.
- My webpage is responsive.
- My code has semantic tags and formatted neatly.
